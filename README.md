# My Awesome Project

Welcome to my awesome project! This project is all about showcasing the power of machine learning.

## Data

I used a large dataset containing images of cats and dogs. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.example.com/dataset).

## Model

For this project, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. You can find the code for the model [here](https://github.com/username/my-awesome-project/blob/main/model.py).

## Results

After training the model on the dataset, here are the results:

- Accuracy: 95%
- Precision: 96%
- Recall: 94%

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the model in action [here](https://www.example.com/demo).

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed exploring my machine learning project. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
